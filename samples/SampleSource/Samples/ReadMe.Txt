With registered mail you will receive the complete 12-disk pack containing all
the 675 samples and docs and demos:
- Drums        (2 disks) - More than 250 samples of the classic analogue and
                           digital drummachines. The Roland TR909 (The Father
                           Of Techno), TR808 (The rap and hiphop drummachine),
                           TR727, and R8. Also the Linn9000, Obermeim DMX and
                           the Simmons kit. This together with a doc and
                           example on how to mix these together to produce
                           complex drumloops using only one channel.
- Bass&Lead    (1 disk)  - Gives you a lot of one-shot and perfectly looped 
                           Analogue Bass and Lead synthesizer sounds. Really
                           Fat and warm samples that cut through butter. 
- Melody       (1 disk)  - All the other synthsounds plus the classics from 
			   the DanceDisk.
- Acid         (2 disks) - 10 different sounds with each 8, 12 or 16 filter
                           settings for making genuine acid lines. Samples 
                           from the Roland TB303, SH101 and Juno1. But also 
                           unusual 24 Db/Oct feedback filter sounds from the 
                           MS6. Complete with doc and demo.
- Loops        (1 disk)  - Original breakbeats. 
- Chords       (5 disks) - This is really unique! from each sound there are 7
                           different chords sampled in 3 or 4 different
                           lengths. This results in VERY realistic organ and
                           synth chord progressions. This is definately
                           something new and original. Doc and example will
                           clearly tell you how to use them. Organ, HousePiano
                           and Analog Brass sounds, but also long strings.
