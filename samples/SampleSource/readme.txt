SampleSource is a collection of 8bit samples in Amiga 8SVX format originally published way back in 1994. These samples should still load fine in most MOD-compatible music trackers such as ReNoise, but will likely require conversion using a tool like SoX before they can be used almost anywhere else.

SampleSource was originally sold as a commercial mail order product delivered on 12 Amiga formatted DD floppy disks. The original file names, directory structure, documentation (Dutch only, sorry), and example MODs have been retained as much as possible. 

Please disregard the copyright claim and order information in ReadMe.Txt; this is obviously no longer valid.
