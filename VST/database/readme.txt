 shortcircuit V2 Database Management
-------------------------------------

The database in shortcircuit allows you to browse only the content you want. It 
also allows you to do an instant free-text search/filter of the database to 
quickly find what you're looking for.

To add content to the database do the following:

1) Create shortcuts to the directories you want to be included in the database in 
the "samples" & "patches" directories. The easiest way to do this is using the 
right-mouse button to drag directories from the windows explorer onto "samples"
or "patches" and selecting "Create Shortcuts Here" from the menu which appears.

2) Click Refresh Database to clear the cache. The directories to which there are
shortcuts will be searched next time shortcircuit is started and included in the
browser. If shortcircuit is already open, you can choose "refresh database" from
the context menu of the browser.

Have patience, the database refresh might take a while if the directories added
contain a large amount of files, but it only has to be done once or when new 
files/directories have been added.
